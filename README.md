# NetworkSpeedMonitor

Your Internet connection is over 100Mbps but your speed tests do not exceed this speed? Even if you have a 1Gbps network device and you have a compatible local network cable, sometimes, during the speed negotiation, it does not set the maximum speed... which forces you to restart the network adapter, disabling and re-enabling it. 

You may not realise it until you notice that downloads are not fast enough to match the speed offered by your **ISP**. This is where **NetworkSpeedMonitor** can help you:

## Installation process

At the end of the installation, the application is not run automatically but is registered to start at the beginning of the Windows boot. If you do not want to restart the computer after installation, go to the installation folder and run it manually.

On the first run the application will ask you to select the network device to monitor, after which it will be saved and will not ask you again, but you can change the network device whenever you want from the context menu of the corresponding tray icon.
