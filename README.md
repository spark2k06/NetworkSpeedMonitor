# NetworkSpeedMonitor

Your Internet connection is over 100Mbps but your speed tests do not exceed this speed? Even if you have a 1Gbps network card and you have a compatible local network cable, sometimes, during the speed negotiation, it does not set the maximum speed... which forces you to restart the network adapter, disabling and re-enabling it. 

You may not realise it until you notice that downloads are not fast enough to match the speed offered by your **ISP**. This is where **NetworkSpeedMonitor** can help you:

**NetworkSpeedMonitor** is a simple and efficient application designed to monitor the speed and status of a computer's network connection. It displays the network speed in real-time and allows users to quickly and easily see the current status of their connection. With its intuitive interface and easy-to-use features, NetworkSpeedMonitor is an ideal solution for users who need to monitor their network connection for troubleshooting or optimization purposes. The application runs in the system tray, allowing users to access its information with just a single click, making it a convenient and low-impact solution for monitoring network connections.

## Installation process

At the end of the installation, the application is not run automatically but is registered to start at the beginning of the Windows boot. If you do not want to restart the computer after installation, go to the installation folder and run it manually.

On the first run the application will ask you to select the network card to monitor, after which it will be saved and will not ask you again, but you can change the network card whenever you want from the context menu of the corresponding tray icon.
